# Fermate Last Theorem
In 16-century Fermate stated a *conjecture* in number theory:


> For $(a,b,c,n) \in N\times N\times N \times N$ and $n \geq 3$. The equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$ has no solution.

And claimed he had the proof! Unfortunately, after nearly 3 decades, Wiles was finally able to prove the conjecture.

## *Loosely & Roughly Speaking*[^ss]

Using sophisticated language(=construction) and techniques from Algebraic Number Theory, Galois Representation, Elliptic Curves, and Complex Analysis.

The story of the proof begins with the "hypothetical" curve named by Gerhard Frey when he found a link between *Elliptic Curves* and *Diophantine Equation* as explained in his paper:
> [Links between stable elliptic curves and certain diophantine equations](https://github.com/FrancescaRossi/frey)

He observed a strong connection between **Fermate Last Theorem** and a conjecture called **Taniyama–Shimura conjecture**:
> All elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ field are related to modular form.

Roughly speaking, he stated that to counterexample **Fermate Last Theorem** you can create a hypothesized curve called later *Fray Curve*, such a curve *is not* modular. Equivalency and simply put, if the *Taniyama–Shimura conjecture* is true, the *Fermate Last Theorem* also is.

Later, Jean-Pierre Serre confirmed this fact and formulated the [Epsilon Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribet%27s_theorem) which proved by Ken Ribet.

> Ribet’s result *only requires* one to prove the conjecture for *semistable* elliptic curves in order to deduce Fermat’s Last Theorem - Quoted from Wiles paper.

So, it is enough to show that **all semistable elliptic curves are modular** to prove **Fermate Last Theorem**.

[^ss]: Trying to simplify the topic in somehow technical language without being too strict.
